# 911-Call-Data-Analytics
This exploratory project is to detect what factors are likely to trigger more 911 calls.  <br>
Tool: Python  <br>
I analyzed the data of 911 calls in the United States with Python(Numpy and Pandas) and visualized the data with Python(Matplotlib, Seaborn)to get insights about key call reasons, peak of call time, and call type.
