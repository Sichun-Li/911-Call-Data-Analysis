# Kaggle: 911 Call Data Analysis
This exploratory project was to detect the main causes and time distribution of 911 calls, helping with public resources management in case of emergency.  <br>
In this project, I analyzed the data of 911 calls in the United States with Python(Numpy and Pandas) and visualized the data with Python(Matplotlib and Seaborn) to get insights about key call reasons, peak of call time, and call type. <br>
